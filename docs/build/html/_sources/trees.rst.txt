Introduction
------------

The ``argparse`` subpackage of arandomness contains scripts and classes
relating to `trees <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)>`_.

OmniTree (Deprecated)
---------------------

OmniTree is a class for creating a tree where each node can contain multiple
children and multiple parents. I began writing this class because I could
not find an extant tree library that supported this many-to-many paradigm.
While binary and/or hierarchical tree with only a single parent are common,
see `anytree <https://anytree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, trees like
OmniTree are not. After a lot of R&D, I realized that these is such a
structure, a
`graph <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)>`_.
Basically, many-to-many trees don't exist because they cannot by definition.
Thus, OmniTree is pointless as there are already amazing libraries for
manipulating and managing graphs, such as
`NetworkX <https://networkx.github.io/>`_. As such, OmniTree is deprecated
and is only included for archival purposes.
