"""Initializes trees package of arandomness

DEPRECATED: This subpackage is not useful as OmniTree's logical conclusion
            is a graph and there are plenty of network graph libraries that
            are far better than I could ever code. I keep this subpackage
            around because I was proud of what I did given my coding knowledge
            at the time and want to memorialize it. I strongly recommend you
            never use this.
